# AI Agent Project 

## Goal of project

Build an LLM-powered command-line program capable of reading, updating, and running Python code using the Gemini API. Learn how LLMs and agentic coding tools work.

## Learning objectives

Write a toy agentic code editor in Python, similar to Claude Code or Cursor's agent mode. Understand how agents work from scratch by using the free Google Gemini API to create an LLM-powered code agent. You'll use function calling and feedback loops to build an agent that can find and fix bugs in a real project!
